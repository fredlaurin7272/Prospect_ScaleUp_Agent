To create a multi-agent system that identifies AI startups raising over $50 million, assesses their AI maturity based on the number of AI Scientists, Data Scientists, and AI Engineers, and extracts top contacts from Apollo, follow this streamlined approach:
1. Identifying AI Startups with Crunchbase
Crunchbase API: Use the API to filter startups that have raised over $50 million. This will be your primary data source for funding information.
2. Assessing AI Maturity
Personnel Data Collection: Develop an agent to gather data on the number of AI Scientists, Data Scientists, and AI Engineers from sources like LinkedIn or company websites.
Scoring System: Create a simple scoring mechanism:
1 point for each AI Scientist
0.5 points for each Data Scientist
0.5 points for each AI Engineer
3. Extracting Top Contacts from Apollo
Apollo API: Utilize Apolloâ€™s API to retrieve contact information based on the company names identified in the previous steps.
Example API Call
To find contacts, use:
text
POST https://api.apollo.io/v1/contacts/search
Set criteria like company name and roles to filter results.
